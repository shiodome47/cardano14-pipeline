While we are committed to accomplish this product anyway, this grant allows us to deliver the results much faster, within the proposed timeline.\n\nDescribe your key performance metrics.\n\nOur key metrics for measuring project success include:\n\nNumber of feedbacks by the Cardano dev community and dApps\n\nNumber of feedbacks by the general Cardano community\n\nNumber of feedbacks by the Bitcoin community\n\nAmount of volume on the Bifrost bridge from and to Bitcoin\n\nAmount of fees generated\n\n[Your Project and Solution] Solution\n\nPlease describe your proposed solution and how it addresses the problem\n\nWe solve the bridging BTC problem - enabling BTC DeFi on Cardano - with Bifrost, an optimistic bridge that doesn’t suffer of the typical BitVM limitations (1-of-n trust assumption, liveness for pegging-out and granular peg-outs), leveraging Cardano key properties such as eUTxO architecture, Proof-of-Stake and network strong decentralisation level.\n\nThe core idea is to leverage Stake Pools (SPOs) consensus to protect the locked BTC on Bitcoin and to move the whole communication, peg-in and peg-out logic on the Cardano side.\n\nSPOs know the Bitcoin confirmed state thanks to the Watchtowers, an open set of players that compete to write the correct chain of new Bitcoin blocks on Cardano. Anyone any time can become a Watchtower, even the user himself.\n\nIt’s important to note that Watchtowers cannot forge or change Bitcoin transactions, fully avoiding the risk of scamming SPOs.\n\nIn this way, users and institutions can independently peg-in and peg-out without intermediaries, knowing that the pegged-in BTCs are secured by the same entities (the SPOs) that are also already trusted for Cardano security.\n\nThe bridge is designed to leverage Cardano, but it can also flawlessly connect Bitcoin to Cardano layer 2s such as Midgard and Sundial.\n\n[Your Project and Solution] Impact\n\nPlease define the positive impact your project will have on the wider Cardano community\n\nBifrost Bitcoin-Cardano bridge will deliver a critical positive impact in all aspects of our beloved community:\n\nCardano dApps: the whole DeFi ecosystem will hugely benefit from the secure and consistent volume of BTCs that will arrive on Cardano looking for yield and other DeFi benefits.\n\nCardano SPOs: the SPO business model secures the Cardano network and strongly depends on the volume and value of ADA. The strong inflow of BTC will increase both of them dramatically.\n\nBitcoin users and institutions: BTC holders are desperate to find yield opportunities that don’t sacrifice the permissionless approach. Cardano and Bifrost solve that.\n\nCardano users: ADA holders will benefit in the appreciation of the Cardano chain and ADA, while also enabling many more opportunities thanks to the increased token volume.\n\n[Your Project and Solution] Capabilities & Feasibility\n\nWhat is your capability to deliver your project with high levels of trust and accountability? How do you intend to validate if your approach is feasible?\n\nAll people involved in our teams are highly senior UTxO researchers and developers: our expertise fully covers Cardano and Bitcoin architecture and development, with a proven track record of successful protocols and infrastructure on both chains. We also have dedicated senior expertise in the Zero Knowledge field to ensure that Cardano on-chain validation allows us to prove anything that happens on the Bitcoin side.\n\nAll team members are well known and highly regarded in the Cardano community.\n\nFluidTokens is also well known in the Bitcoin community.\n\nWe are fully equipped to execute this project from beginning to the end.\n\n[Milestones] Project Milestones\n\nMilestone Title\n\nBridge Architecture Design Formalization\n\nMilestone Outputs\n\nDefine the bridge core components, the flow of the happy and unhappy paths, the main smart contracts, the main algorithms used for signature aggregation and SPOs communication.

Physical commodities—especially metals and minerals—remain off-chain due to missing traceability, tokenization infrastructure, and compliance layers. This limits institutional participation, reduces utility for ADA holders, and restricts Cardano’s DeFi TVL growth.\n\n:\n\nMine. Trace. Tokenize. DeFi.\n\nWe will launch the\n\nfirst fully-traced, tokenized\n\n, and DeFi-integrated RWA commodities ecosystem on Cardano—starting with gold. In partnership with a Latin American mining group operating 14 mines producing over 30 minerals, we will:\n\nDeploy End-to-End Traceability\n\n: Track mining operations, processes, and outputs with secure, tamper-proof digital records via Palmyra Pro’s traceability modules.\n\nDevelop Proof of Reserve Capabilities\n\n: Collaborate with custodians of refined mining assets to provide real-time auditability and transparent reporting of assets held in custody via IoT integrations. This will leverage zenGate’s Merkle Oracles which are custom built for RWA events.\n\nDevelop the RWC (Real-World-Commodities) Tokenization Engine\n\n: Design and implement minting and burning logic for on-chain assets, including tools for institutional actors to manage asset records, submit mint/burn requests, and perform metadata updates.\n\nDevelop Physical Redemption Processes\n\n: Enable a redemption protocol where holders of the on-chain RWA commodity token can request and receive physical delivery.\n\nCardano DeFi Integration\n\n: Integrate tokenized commodities into the existing Cardano DeFi ecosystem, including commodity indexes (e.g. Xerberus), lending markets (e.g. Liqwid), decentralized exchanges (e.g Minswap), and other synthetic indexes.\n\n[Your Project and Solution] Impact\n\nPlease define the positive impact your project will have on the wider Cardano community\n\nUnlocks DeFi Use-Cases for Real-World Assets\n\n: Allows users to lend, borrow, or speculate on tokenized commodities (such as gold, lithium and more).\n\nInstitutional-Grade Onboarding\n\n: Brings real production, audit, and proof-of-reserve data from large mines on-chain.\n\nBoosts Network Activity\n\n: Every batch, conversion, redemption, and trade generates on-chain volume.\n\nTVL Growth on Cardano\n\n: every tokenized commodity that comes onto Cardano will boost ecosystem TVL; not by just millions of dollars but 10s and 100s of millions of dollars.\n\nScalable Blueprint\n\n: Built to extend across multiple commodity assets, locations globally, and partners.\n\nEnhances Cardano’s Position as an RWA Leader\n\n: Helps Cardano compete with Ethereum, Base, Ripple, Solana and other ecosystems in the RWA category.\n\n[Your Project and Solution] Capabilities & Feasibility\n\nWhat is your capability to deliver your project with high levels of trust and accountability?

It provides tangible utility for Cardano's infrastructure beyond purely digital assets.\n\nDeFi Ecosystem Expansion\n\n: By integrating tokenized commodities with existing protocols such as Xerberus, Liqwid, and Minswap, this project enhances the composability and diversity of DeFi use cases—unlocking collateral, trading, lending, and synthetic index products.\n\nSpeculative and Institutional Participation\n\n: Tokenized, on-chain commodities offer exposure to real-world assets, opening the door for both retail and institutional players to speculate, hedge, and invest via Cardano-based financial tools.\n\nIncreased Users, TVL, and Transactions\n\n: As physical commodities are traced, tokenized, and traded, we expect significant growth in transaction volume and wallet activity. Each mined, tokenized, and redeemed asset represents multiple on-chain events.\n\nScalability Across Commodities and Regions\n\n: While gold is the starting point, the infrastructure is designed to support over 30 minerals across 14+ mines. This system can be replicated for agriculture, energy, and other supply chain sectors globally.\n\nEnterprise-Ready Integration Model\n\n: With Proof of Reserve tooling, redemption flows, and traceability APIs, this creates a trusted and auditable pathway for enterprises and institutions to interact with Cardano.\n\nTVL Growth and Long-Term Utility for ADA\n\n: By anchoring real-world value on-chain, ADA’s utility as a governance, transaction, and economic coordination token is amplified—benefiting the entire Cardano ecosystem.\n\nADA Holder Benefits\n\n: High transaction volume, DeFi adoption, and global visibility enhance Cardano’s utility, potentially appreciating ADA’s value.\n\n[Required Acknowledgements] Consent & Confirmation\n\nTerms and Conditions:\n\n+ Read more\n\nDaniel Friedman (Proposal Delivery Lead)\n\n: Oversees strategy and partner coordination.\n\nSam Lambert (Development and Deployment Project Lead)\n\n: Manages project execution and workshops.\n\nTheodore Morisis\n\n(Ops and Account Manager)\n\nLuca D’Angelo,  Shishir Pai and Luiz Oliveira (Lead Developers)\n\n: Develop Winter Protocol, credentials, and DeFi smart contracts.\n\n15+ zenGate Experts\n\n: Support blockchain, DeFi, data analytics, traceability mapping, and ESG compliance.\n\nLamon Rutten:\n\nAdvisor, RWA and Commodities Expert overseeing implementation.\n\nzenGate Global\n\nThe project\n\nBrowse funded ideas\n\nMedia kit\n\nContact\n\nFAQ & tech support\n\nIdeaScale support\n\nContact moderator\n\nResources\n\nCardano.org\n\nCardano Foundation\n\nEssential Cardano\n\nIOHK\n\nIOG Academy\n\nLegal\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nTerms and Conditions\n\nWe'll be in touch soon with news and updates from the Project Catalyst community.\n\nSubscribe\n\n© 2025 Input Output Global · All Rights Reserved",

(\n\nhttps://minswap.org\n\n)\n\nDanogo Flexible Lending Pool :   the borrow-and-lend infrastructure for leverage. This collaboration enables seamless leverage funding and repayment within the protocol. (\n\nhttps://app.danogo.io\n\nTogether they form the foundation for Cardano’s first spot leverage with on-chain limit orders.\n\nDescribe funding commitments.\n\nDanogo Team:  Contributing internal resources (engineers, front-end, analysts) worth ~$22k in man-hours to deliver lending integration and leverage protocol with open/close position, liquidation , and monitoring features.\n\nMinswap Collaboration: While Minswap is not providing direct funding, they are supporting with technical guidance and integration support to ensure smooth interaction with their batcher and limit order system\n\nAll Catalyst funding requested will go directly toward completing smart contract development, audits, UI/UX work, and community testing.\n\nDescribe your key performance metrics.\n\nOur KPIs measure adoption, trading activity, and ecosystem growth:\n\nExecuted limit orders – show use of automated TP/SL.\n\nUnique wallets – track protocol adoption across Cardano.\n\nTrading volume (USD) – reflects capital efficiency and contribution.\n\nThese KPIs matter because adoption proves user need, while volume and TVL growth show real impact on Cardano DeFi. Metrics will be tracked on-chain and shared publicly for transparency.\n\n[Your Project and Solution] Solution\n\nPlease describe your proposed solution and how it addresses the problem\n\nCurrently, Cardano offers perpetual trading but does not support leverage trading with on-chain limit orders.\n\nThis leaves traders without the ability to set automated entries, stop-losses, or take-profit targets when borrowing assets to trade through DEX liquidity.\n\nAs a result, they must monitor prices manually, limiting strategy diversity and discouraging professional traders.\n\nPropose solution\n\nOur solution is to develop Cardano’s first spot leverage trading protocol integrated with Danogo Flexible Lending Pool (for borrow/lend infrastructure) and Minswap (Cardano’s largest DEX with batcher market/limit orders).\n\nThis combination enables traders to:\n\nOpen and close leveraged positions directly through Danogo Flexible Lending Pool and  Minswap pools.\n\nPlace limit, stop-loss, and take-profit orders stored on-chain and executed automatically when price conditions are met.\n\nBenefit from transparent liquidation flows, where collateral is swapped on-chain in a single transaction.\n\nHow the solution works\n\nOpen Position : A trader can open a leveraged position using either market or limit price. The leverage protocol borrows assets from the Danogo Flexible Lending Pool and places a swap order on Minswap at the user’s chosen price. The received tokens from Minswap are deposited as collateral backing the trader’s position.\n\nExecution : The system uses Minswap’s batcher limit order to swap assets and execute the trade (open/close/adjust). When Minswap pool prices match the order condition, the order is filled and the swapped tokens are sent back to the leverage protocol smart contract.\n\nClose Position : Traders can set take profit or stop loss orders for fully filled positions. When triggered, the leverage protocol uses the collateral from the position to place a swap on Minswap. The swapped assets are then used to repay the initial borrowed amount, and any remaining balance becomes the trader’s profit.\n\nRisk Management:  If market prices move against the trader and the position’s health factor falls below the required threshold, the position enters a liquidatable state. At this point, any user (liquidator) can trigger the liquidation by calling the protocol. The protocol will swap the collateral on Minswap in an onchain transaction to repay the loan, and the liquidator receives a reward for maintaining protocol solvency\n\nUser Monitoring:  Through the dApp dashboard, traders can monitor real-time metrics: entry price, current PnL, liquidation price, and active TP/SL orders.\n\nThis workflow delivers fully automated leverage trading with conditional orders, combining Danogo’s lending infrastructure with Minswap’s liquidity and batcher system.\n\nHigh Level Architecture\n\nWhy this approach\n\nMost Cardano DEXs operate with a batcher mechanism, where a swap requires two matched orders. Among them, Minswap is the largest DEX on Cardano, with diverse pools and deep liquidity, making it the most effective starting point for integration.\n\nBy leveraging Minswap’s limit order system and liquidity, our protocol enables execution at target prices, reducing slippage and overfill risk compared to market swaps.\n\nOnce integrated with Minswap, the leverage protocol can be extended to other DEXs such as Splash, VyFinance, and WingRiders, ensuring broader reach and ecosystem compatibility.\n\nOur solution focuses on spot leverage (borrow–swap), which differs from perpetuals: assets remain transparent, and all borrow–swap–liquidation flows occur directly on a DEX. This complements existing perpetual products on Cardano rather than competing with them, expanding the range of trading strategies available to users\n\nBuilt on a UTxO-native design, limit, stop-loss, and take-profit orders are stored as UTxOs, monitored by keepers using pool price (TWAP), and triggered automatically when conditions are met, with support for partial fills.\n\nTarget users\n\nMid- to high-level DeFi traders (swing/position) who want automated limit/TP/SL orders for leveraged positions.\n\nExisting Minswap users and other dApps needing atomic leverage as a building block (aggregators, vaults).\n\nImpact\n\nImpact will be proven by on-chain KPIs such as number of unique wallets, executed limit orders, leveraged trading volume,. These metrics will be tracked through explorers and public dashboards to ensure transparency.\n\nThis solution is unique because it delivers a new trading primitive for Cardano :\n\nautomated spot leverage with conditional order execution;\n\ncreating stronger incentives for traders to remain in the ecosystem, while driving liquidity, transaction volume, and overall DeFi maturity.\n\n[Your Project and Solution] Impact\n\nPlease define the positive impact your project will have on the wider Cardano community\n\nPositive Impact\n\nThis project introduces Cardano’s first leverage trading protocol with on-chain limit orders, filling a critical gap in the DeFi ecosystem.\n\nBy combining Danogo’s lending infrastructure with Minswap’s liquidity and limit order system, we enable traders to set automated entries, stop-loss, and take-profit conditions directly on-chain.\n\nThe impact for the Cardano community includes:\n\nEnhanced DeFi toolkit, Attract professional and strategy-driven traders to Cardano DeFi. : Professional traders gain access to CEX-like functionality in a decentralized environment.\n\nIncreased adoption and activity – More active trading strategies will drive higher transaction volume and TVL across Cardano DEXs.\n\nLiquidity growth – Integration with Minswap deepens usage of existing liquidity pools and encourages further participation.\n\nImprove capital efficiency by allowing traders to set precise price targets without constant monitoring.\n\nOpen-source contribution : Smart contracts will be shared publicly, enabling other builders to extend the solution.\n\nMeasuring Impact\n\nWe will track on-chain metrics, including:\n\nNumber of limit orders executed & fill rate.\n\nLeveraged trading volume.\n\nUnique connected wallets.\n\nPosition holding time\n\nSharing Outputs\n\nOpen-source smart contracts published on GitHub.\n\nPublic web app for community testing.\n\nTransparent reporting of adoption metrics, user feedback, and technical updates via Github, or gitbook or Google Drive.\n\n[Your Project and Solution] Capabilities & Feasibility\n\nWhat is your capability to deliver your project with high levels of trust and accountability?

Proposed Solution\n\n- Develop Cardano’s first spot leverage trading protocol integrated with:\n  - **Danogo Flexible Lending Pool** for borrow/lend infrastructure.\n  - **Minswap**, Cardano’s largest DEX, for batcher market/limit order execution.\n- Features include:\n  - Opening/closing leveraged positions with market or limit prices.\n  - On-chain storage and automatic execution of limit, stop-loss, and take-profit orders.\n  - Transparent liquidation where collateral is swapped on-chain in a single transaction.\n- Workflow:\n  - Traders borrow assets from Danogo, place swap orders on Minswap at target prices.\n  - Orders execute automatically when price conditions are met.\n  - Liquidation triggered if position health falls below threshold, with rewards for liquidators.\n- Built on UTxO-native design with orders stored as UTxOs and monitored by keepers.\n- Target users: mid-to-high level DeFi traders and dApps requiring atomic leverage.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Collaborations & Team\n\n- **Partnerships:**\n  - **Minswap:** Technical guidance and integration support for batcher and limit order system.\n  - **Danogo Flexible Lending Pool:** Lending infrastructure and internal resource contribution (~$22k man-hours).\n- **Team Members:**\n  - Duong Thu Huong – Product Consultant\n  - Pham Tung Giang – Solution Architect, Smart Contract Lead\n  - Tran Anh Quan – Smart Contract Engineer\n  - Trương Quang Hung – Backend Engineer (Kotlin)\n  - Vo Yen Nhi – Frontend Developer\n  - Le Thi Thanh Ngan – Quality Control\n- No external dependencies beyond these collaborations.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Expected Impact\n\n- Introduces Cardano’s first leverage trading with on-chain conditional orders, filling a critical DeFi gap.\n- Attracts professional and strategy-driven traders by offering CEX-like features in a decentralized environment.\n- Increases adoption, trading volume, and TVL across Cardano DEXs.\n- Deepens liquidity usage on Minswap and encourages ecosystem participation.\n- Improves capital efficiency by enabling precise price targets without constant monitoring.\n- Open-source smart contracts foster further ecosystem innovation.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Key Performance Metrics (KPIs)\n\n- Number of executed limit orders (automated TP/SL usage).\n- Unique wallets interacting with the protocol.\n- Leveraged trading volume in USD.\n- Position holding time.\n- All KPIs tracked on-chain and shared publicly for transparency.\n\n---\n\n## 6.

Additionally, we work closely with the Steelswap.io and Moneta teams to develop innovations such as the Cardano Token Data API, Charli3 Dendrite, and USDM's Proof of Reserve. We have an established MOU with Fida.finance and the Howden Group, ongoing discussions with RWA specialists such as Zengate and their World Food F14 proposal. That said, this proposal is to enhance our existing mainnet solution (partnerchain oracle network) to onboard with RWA, Insurance/Finance, and cross-chain integrations.\n\nDescribe funding commitments.\n\nOur MOU with the Howden grop agrees to support up to 2M in funding for an insurance use-case. But to be abundantly clear, we are submitting this proposal as a Community governed oracle partnerchain so Cardano builders can launch, manage, and use their own custom oracle networks. These will include templates for micro finance, insurance, RWA, price feeds, and anything else listed in the marketplace.\n\nDescribe your key performance metrics.\n\nSuccess will be measured by launching the marketplace with wallet login, 5+ ready-to-use oracle templates, and at least 10 operators listed. Our goal is Wo onboard 25+ people to the marketpalce.  Likewise we aim for 3–5 active oracle networks posting data, generating 50k+ mainnet transactions on Cardano during the project period. Adoption will be validated through marketplace activity, operator participation, and template usage, establishing a strong foundation for future growth. Integrations enabling direct on-chain token data from an Ethereum chain and midnight are stretch goals.\n\n[Your Project and Solution] Solution\n\nPlease describe your proposed solution and how it addresses the problem\n\nTLDR: Opensource Partnerchain with Oracle Launchpad and Marketplace\n\nWhat’s the Problem?\n\nOracle infrastructure on Cardano today is fragmented and fragile. Builders operate in silos, spinning up “oracles” that are little more than centralized data feeds, multi-sig scripts, or API pulls dressed up as robust systems. Every Catalyst round funds dozens of RWA price feeds or “oracle” projects that ultimately duplicate work without creating shared standards. Communities are tribalistic, protective of their tokens, and unwilling to cooperate across networks. Meanwhile, outside of Cardano, oracles are understood as essential infrastructure — projects like Supra or Flare receive $15–90M in funding because blockchains cannot function securely at scale without them.\n\nThe consequences of weak oracle infrastructure are real and devastating:\n\nMango Markets (2022):\n\n$114M drained after oracle price manipulation.\n\nbZx Protocol (2020):\n\n$8M stolen due to reliance on a single manipulated data point.\n\nCompound (2021):\n\n$147M mistakenly distributed because of an oracle misconfiguration.\n\nCardano cannot afford to repeat these mistakes, yet adoption of robust oracle infrastructure here remains low. Orcfax is still testing its incentivized off-chain model without a mainnet solution fully deployed with it. Bootstrapped multi-sig “oracles” continue to be spun up in isolation. And the lack of a common marketplace or shared foundation means protocols are forced to choose between competing, incomplete solutions — or build their own from scratch.\n\nOur Track Record\n\nCharli3\n\nhas proven what’s possible. We\n\nstarted building the first decentralized oracle on Cardano in 2021, deployed to mainnet in October 2022 with 100% uptime and zero failures\n\n. We have delivered 11/11 funded Catalyst projects, completed research into Input Output’s partnerchain tooling, and\n\nbuilt the first functioning partnerchain use-case:\n\na decentralized oracle MVP posting data directly onto Cardano. Our data has been rock solid, our track record unmatched.\n\nSo why hasn’t adoption surged?\n\nThe reality is simple: running oracles on Cardano is\n\nexpensive and inefficient\n\n. Every data post carries an on-chain transaction fee, which compounds quickly and makes sustainable use impractical. Without a shared infrastructure layer, every project has to rebuild the same components from scratch—wasting resources, fragmenting the ecosystem, and driving up costs that most teams simply cannot afford.\n\nOff-chain oracle solutions try to bypass this, but they create a different problem:\n\ntrust\n\n. Without on-chain records or transparent explorers, users must take the operator’s word for what happened, opening the door to hidden risks and unverifiable claims. For cash-strapped Cardano projects, the temptation is to adopt the lowest-cost solution that “works,” even if it sacrifices security.\n\nThe danger is that these risks don’t always show up in everyday market conditions. They surface in moments of volatility—like during the U.S. election, when liquidations quietly rippled through protocols while end users were none the wiser. Bootstrapped multi-sig feeds and API hacks can hold together in calm markets, but history across other chains (Mango, bZx, Compound) shows that when stress hits,\n\nthe costs of fragile oracles are paid in the hundreds of millions.\n\nYet the conversation on Cardano often gets muddied. Politics, tribalism, and social drama drown out real technical concerns. Builders face the perverse incentive of silence: to admit data insecurity is to admit potential exposure of user funds, and admitting that risk often obligates them to adopt more expensive solutions that their budgets simply cannot handle. It’s easier to downplay the problem than to confront it head-on.\n\nTHE SOLUTION\n\nThis proposal changes all that\n\n.\n\nWe will evolve our existing partnerchain MVP into a\n\ncommunity-owned oracle launchpad and marketplace\n\n— a public resource where everything needed to spin up a new oracle network is in one place:\n\nReady-to-use oracle templates (everything needed to pull price feeds, setup RWA Pricing oracles, and etc.)\n\nListings of oracle data providers and node operators.\n\nDocumentation, guides, and education for builders.\n\nA transparent governance model to ensure community oversight.\n\nAn open-source framework, allowing anyone to also run their own private network if they prefer.\n\nThe marketplace is designed to remove fragmentation by giving builders a single hub to access oracle templates, connect with data providers, and onboard node operators. Instead of siloed, one-off oracle solutions, the **partnerchain becomes a neutral infrastructure layer **— low-cost, scalable, and open.\n\nThe goal is bigger than just infrastructure: it is to\n\ndrive community, communication, adoption, and education\n\n. Charli3 could wait for the bull market to expose weaknesses in existing oracle setups and profit from solving those issues. Instead, we are choosing to open up everything we’ve built, invite the community to participate, and deliver a better data infrastructure layer for Cardano as a whole.\n\nDeliverables\n\nOpen sourcing and Access\n\nOpen source the Charli3 oracle codebase under a restricted license during development, with full MIT license release after completion.\n\nOpen access to the partnerchain MVP and bridge solution.\n\nPartnerchain MVP enhancements\n\nIntegrations with Cardano, Midnight, and Ethereum to supply direct on-chain token data.\n\nEnhancements including a flexible reward mechanism so networks can use any token as their base currency.\n\nLaunch Oracle Marketplace\n\nLaunch of the marketplace with wallet login, oracle templates, operator listings, and data provider monetization.\n\nOnboard additional node operators to expand participation.\n\nDocumentation, guides, and educational materials to make adoption straightforward.\n\nEcosystem and Governance Plan\n\nEcosystem onboarding: Expanded node operator participation, plus documentation, guides, and workshops to support adoption.\n\nClear transition path from Charli3-managed networks to community-run networks.\n\nThis is not a whiteboard idea. We already have a functioning mainnet solution. This project funds the\n\nenhancement and scaling\n\nof that solution into a neutral, community-driven marketplace — one that ensures Cardano enters the next market cycle with the robust oracle infrastructure it deserves.\n\nRollout Plan\n\n**Months 1–3: **Open source release, partnerchain MVP access, and publication of initial documentation.\n\nMonths 4–6:\n\nCore enhancements delivered (integrations + flexible reward mechanism).\n\nMonths 7–9:\n\nMarketplace launch with wallet login, templates, and operator/data provider listings.\n\nMonths 10–12:\n\nGovernance framework rollout, expanded onboarding of node operators, educational workshops, and final MIT license release.\n\nUser Journeys\n\nOther Oracles: Competing oracles can list their templates, contribute adapters, or even launch managed networks on the marketplace. Instead of fragmentation, they gain visibility and adoption while keeping their autonomy.\n\nData Providers: Whether AI agents, exchanges, or institutional feeds, providers can publish adapters on the marketplace and monetize access. This creates new revenue streams and lets builders easily plug in their data.\n\nNode Operators: Operators join the marketplace, are listed transparently, and connect directly with builders. Instead of being locked into a single vendor, they can secure multiple networks and earn rewards.\n\nDeFi and Lending Builders: A protocol needing reliable price feeds for loans can select a ready-to-use template, choose trusted operators, and connect to data sources — all without reinventing the wheel.\n\nRWA Builders: Projects tokenizing assets like real estate or commodities can use pre-built RWA oracle templates, connect to on-chain feeds, and ensure reliable pricing without designing infrastructure from scratch.\n\nRetail Users: Everyday Cardano community members benefit indirectly. With stronger oracle infrastructure, lending, trading, and RWA platforms become safer and more transparent, reducing systemic risk of loss.\n\n[Your Project and Solution] Impact\n\nPlease define the positive impact your project will have on the wider Cardano community\n\nImpact\n\nThe impact of this proposal is to make oracle adoption on Cardano a reality, not just an aspiration. We remove barriers, lower costs, and entice the community to actively participate by running and securing the Partnerchain.\n\nEmpowering the Community\n\nCommunity members will not just consume data — they will earn yield by staking and securing networks, voting on operator performance, and becoming active participants in governance. This keeps the Partnerchain sustainable while ensuring that ownership stays with the Cardano ecosystem.\n\nCross-Chain Connectivity\n\nWith direct on-chain reads and posting capabilities, C3 Networks connects Cardano to other blockchains — including Ethereum, Polkadot, and the upcoming Midnight. This bridges Cardano’s protocols with external ecosystems, creating a two-way data highway that expands Cardano’s reach and relevance in the multi-chain era.\n\nMarketplace of Oracles\n\nInstead of\n\n15 isolated RWA price oracles\n\n, all with fragmented adoption and limited support, we deliver a\n\nsingle unified marketplace\n\n. Builders can find what they need in one place, whether it’s an RWA template, a DeFi price feed, or exotic agent-driven data streams. Developers can also monetize their own templates, creating an ecosystem of reusable infrastructure. This ensures that adoption compounds rather than fragments.\n\nSolving Fragmented Innovation\n\nRight now, oracle innovation on Cardano is fragmented. Each team reinvents the wheel, and siloed approaches slow adoption. With the Partnerchain marketplace, we unify these efforts under a single framework. Vendors like Orcfax can participate as marketplace providers, offering managed closed-source networks or publishing templates alongside community-created oracles. This puts power back in the builders’ hands while creating a level playing field. New innovations can thrive here without competing destructively, and the community gains a single robust oracle infrastructure it can trust.\n\nDecentralization Beyond the Protocol Layer\n\nCardano’s base chain is world-class, and its dApps are thriving. But in between them lies a weak point: centralized, bootstrapped, or unsafe data infrastructures. With C3 Networks, we fill that gap, creating a decentralized data infrastructure layer that is transparent, secure, and community-run. This strengthens Cardano’s claim as a fully decentralized ecosystem.\n\nTier 1 Data Integrations\n\nBy enabling Cardano-run oracle networks to source and post data across chains, we unlock tier 1 integrations that are otherwise out of reach. This includes token data, RWA feeds, and new agentic use cases. These integrations will increase Cardano’s competitiveness with global solutions like Chainlink while showcasing the strength of our community-driven model.\n\nBuilding a Public Good for Cardano\n\nCharli3 is deliberately stepping back from being a managed service provider and evolving into a steward of a public good. By committing to an MIT open-source license after the development phase, we ensure that the Partnerchain will be free, transparent, and community-controlled for the long term. This eliminates vendor lock-in and maximizes Cardano’s ability to attract enterprise, RWA, and DeFi adoption.\n\nGlobal Competitiveness & Urgency\n\nChainlink already secures billions of dollars across DeFi, with over $15B+ lost on other chains in the past three years due to oracle failures, exploits, and mispriced data feeds. These failures include:\n\nMango Markets (2022)\n\n–\n\n$114M drained\n\ndue to\n\noracle price manipulation\n\nbZx Protocol (2020)\n\n$8M stolen\n\nafter a single data point manipulation.\n\nCompound (2021)\n\n$147M\n\nmistakenly distributed because of an\n\noracle misconfiguration\n\nCardano has so far avoided these disasters, but only because adoption is still maturing. Entering the next bull market without this infrastructure would be a grave risk. The time to fund and secure this project is overdue — Cardano must catch up to ensure its protocols and users are protected.\n\nQuantifiable Results & Measurable Impact\n\nTransaction Volume:\n\nTargeting 500,000+ on-chain data points posted during the 10-month period — ensuring constant activity and transparency.\n\nCommunity Participation:\n\n50+ external node operators onboarded and 100+ community stakers actively securing networks.\n\n**\n\nTemplate Adoption:\n\n**At least 5 custom oracle templates created, including 2 for RWAs, enabling plug-and-play adoption by DeFi and enterprise builders.\n\nProtocol Safety:\n\nAdoption by major Cardano DeFi protocols will reduce risk of liquidations and mispriced assets. Oracle failures have cost users $100M+ in single events on Ethereum — this infrastructure prevents Cardano from repeating those mistakes.\n\nCross-Chain Reach:\n\nLive integrations with Cardano, Ethereum, Polkadot, and Midnight — extending Cardano’s relevance across ecosystems.\n\nDeveloper Output:\n\n10+ new dApps or integrations leveraging C3 Networks within the first year, showcasing real-world use cases and commercial viability.\n\nBy tying funding to measurable adoption, safety, and transaction counts, this project guarantees visible, quantifiable results that will solidify Cardano’s position as a leading blockchain ecosystem.\n\n[Your Project and Solution] Capabilities & Feasibility\n\nWhat is your capability to deliver your project with high levels of trust and accountability? How do you intend to validate if your approach is feasible?\n\nCharli3 is one of the oldest and most recognized projects in the Cardano ecosystem, active since 2021 and continuously building without pause. In that time, we have delivered 11/11 Catalyst-funded projects on track to completion with a proven history of accountability and follow-through. We are best known for launching the first decentralized oracle solution on Cardano in October 2022, which has operated with 100% ecosystem uptime since inception. This is not theory or promises — our team has already executed at scale and delivered working mainnet infrastructure where others remain in testnet phases.\n\nTrack Record of Delivery\n\n11 Catalyst-funded proposals delivered with evidence-based reporting.\n\nTwo successful third-party audits completed (CertiK and Anastasia Labs).\n\nFirst functioning partnerchain use case: a decentralized oracle MVP in Substrate posting data directly to Cardano.\n\nProven collaboration with major Cardano labs including TxPipe and MLabs, alongside deep engagement with dApps, SPOs, and infrastructure providers.\n\nLongstanding credibility as ecosystem educators and contributors, with leadership that has also advised at Emurgo Academy.\n\nList of Notable Completed Projects:\n\nhttps://milestones.projectcatalyst.io/projects/1100090\n\nhttps://milestones.projectcatalyst.io/projects/1100093\n\nhttps://milestones.projectcatalyst.io/projects/1300066\n\nWhile competitors are still in incentivized testnet or using limited multi-sig setups, Charli3 has shipped real, reliable mainnet infrastructure. The aim of this proposal is to evolve that infrastructure from a team-administered MVP into a\n\ncommunity-governed, open-source launchpad and marketplace\n\n— one that the entire Cardano ecosystem can use, extend, and scale.\n\nTechnical Feasibility\n\nWe have already solved the hardest problem: building and deploying a functioning partnerchain oracle network that posts data to Cardano. Building on this foundation is a natural, achievable next step.\n\nPartnerchain expertise: Our research and implementation of the oracle MVP demonstrated how Substrate-based sidechains can inherit Cardano’s security guarantees. This is live, auditable code, not a whiteboard design.\n\nOracle depth: From token feeds to RWAs, we understand the challenges of cost efficiency, governance, latency, and integrity. Our design experience includes cross-chain integrations with EVM chains, Polkadot, and upcoming Cardano ecosystem chains like Midnight.\n\nEcosystem integration: Our enhancements will include flexible reward mechanisms that allow any token as a base currency, templates for rapid deployment, and integrations to bring direct on-chain token data from Cardano, Midnight, and Ethereum.\n\nWhy We Can Deliver\n\nCharli3’s history of shipping live infrastructure, passing audits, and collaborating with key Cardano labs makes us one of the most credible teams in the ecosystem. From Haskell/Plutus smart contracts to Rust/Substrate partnerchain tooling, our cross-functional expertise spans the full stack of oracle engineering. We have built bridges, on-chain logic, validator rewards, governance structures, and partnerchain infrastructure already proven on mainnet.\n\nRecognizing Gaps\n\nWhile our technical record is unmatched, adoption requires more than code. Fragmentation, tribalism, and high costs have slowed oracle adoption on Cardano. We recognize that to succeed, this marketplace needs marketing, onboarding, and community engagement beyond our core technical team. We will seek outside support to ensure that builders, node operators, and data providers are not only aware of the platform but equipped to use it effectively.\n\nWhy Fund This Now\n\nCardano’s DeFi and RWA ecosystem is growing, but oracle adoption is dangerously behind other blockchains. Competing chains fund oracles at levels of $15M–$90M because they are mission-critical infrastructure. Without a shared infrastructure layer, Cardano risks entering the bull cycle with fragmented, unsafe, or prohibitively expensive data solutions — putting protocols and user funds at risk. The time to act is overdue.\n\nCharli3 is uniquely positioned to deliver this transformation: we already run the mainnet MVP, we have the ecosystem’s trust, and we are committing to open-sourcing all code so the marketplace becomes a neutral, community-owned public good. What we need now is the community’s support to expand, decentralize, and formalize this infrastructure so Cardano enters the next market cycle prepared.\n\n[Milestones] Project Milestones\n\nMilestone

contingency buffer (₳59,500) is built into the allocations above. This ensures flexibility if additional audits, infrastructure scaling, or external marketing are required. If not fully used, remaining contingency will be rolled into community adoption campaigns and grants to onboard external node operators and data providers.\n\n[Final Pitch] Value for Money\n\nHow does the cost of the project represent value for the Cardano ecosystem?\n\nWe believe this proposal represents exceptional value for money for the Cardano ecosystem. With a total budget of ₳595,000 distributed across six structured milestones, we will deliver a fully open-source, production-ready oracle launchpad and marketplace. This will provide an enduring public good that lowers barriers to adoption, unifies fragmented efforts, and ensures Cardano enters the next market cycle with a robust, scalable data infrastructure.\n\nThe following points highlight why this initiative delivers strong value relative to cost:\n\n1. Proven Track Record of Delivery\n\nCharli3 is one of the oldest and most recognized names in the Cardano ecosystem. We have established relationships with major development labs such as TxPipe, MLabs, and others, and we have already passed two independent audits (CertiK and Anastasia Labs).\n\nWe have repeatedly shown that we can deliver technically complex solutions on time and to a high standard. This proposal is not a “whiteboard idea.” We already have a working partnerchain MVP and a functioning mainnet solution. Catalyst funding will be used to scale and open access, not to start from scratch.\n\nOur history demonstrates that we take stewardship seriously, and that funds allocated will translate directly into tangible infrastructure for the community.\n\n2. Open Source, Public Good Orientation\n\nThe project explicitly open-sources all code, beginning under a restricted license during development and releasing fully under MIT upon completion. This ensures the Cardano ecosystem gains a permanent, reusable foundation for oracle networks.\n\nBy open-sourcing, we prevent vendor lock-in and give the community freedom to adapt, extend, or fork the infrastructure for specialized use cases. This creates compounding ecosystem value beyond the life of the grant.\n\nOther oracle providers or teams (including competitors) will be able to benefit from the codebase, marketplace, and partnerchain infrastructure. In this way, Catalyst funding acts as an investment in ecosystem resilience, not in a single company.\n\n3. Efficient Budget Structure\n\nThe total budget is divided into six milestones, each with clear deliverables, acceptance criteria, and evidence of completion. This ensures funds are only released against proven progress, reducing risk of misallocation.\n\nCost per milestone has been carefully calibrated: early funding focuses on hiring and open-sourcing (₳75,000), while the heaviest investment is in integration and infrastructure work (₳175,000). Costs then taper as the project moves into testing, documentation, and launch.\n\nAll costings have been broken down by role, hours, and rate to demonstrate a transparent and professional financial plan. This is not a “lump sum” request; every ADA has a defined purpose and accountability path.\n\nA 10% contingency buffer (₳59,500) ensures unexpected requirements can be met (e.g., extra audits, infra scaling, or user support) without threatening timelines. Any unused contingency will be redirected to community adoption campaigns and onboarding support.\n\n4. High Leverage for Ecosystem Impact\n\nOracle infrastructure is a critical bottleneck for Cardano adoption. Without affordable, accessible, and standardized oracles, DeFi, RWA platforms, and other dApps cannot scale.\n\nBy lowering the cost of running oracles and removing duplication of effort, this project creates a shared public layer that all builders can leverage. This drives down the entry cost for new protocols, increasing ecosystem diversity and competitiveness.\n\nThe marketplace provides a one-stop resource for builders, including templates, operator listings, and data providers. This significantly reduces developer friction and accelerates time-to-market for new projects.\n\nEnabling any token as a base currency for oracle networks unlocks flexibility for diverse projects. Builders can tailor economic models to their own communities, encouraging experimentation and growth.\n\n5. Community Engagement and Inclusivity\n\nThe marketplace is designed to onboard node operators, data providers, DeFi builders, RWA innovators, and even retail participants. Each user group has a defined journey within the ecosystem, ensuring that benefits extend widely rather than concentrating in a small circle.\n\nBy publishing extensive documentation, guides, and tutorials, we lower the barrier to entry for new builders and ensure adoption is not limited to established teams.\n\nGovernance and oversight will be structured for transparency and community ownership, reducing trust assumptions and giving stakeholders a voice in how the infrastructure evolves.\n\nThis is not just about building tools — it is about fostering a community-driven data layer that strengthens Cardano as a whole.\n\n6. Comparative Cost-Effectiveness\n\nWhen compared to the scale of funding required by other blockchain ecosystems for similar infrastructure (e.g., multi-million USD grants for oracle and infra projects on Ethereum, Polkadot, or Solana), this budget is highly efficient.\n\nFor under ₳600,000, Catalyst is funding the creation of a permanent open-source launchpad and marketplace that removes one of Cardano’s most persistent adoption barriers.\n\nThe infrastructure delivered here will have a multi-year lifespan and support multiple bull and bear cycles, without requiring repeated reinvestment at the same scale.\n\n7. Long-Term Sustainability\n\nBy onboarding node operators and enabling staking participation, the partnerchain will become self-sustaining. Node operators earn rewards, while projects launching oracles contribute fees. This reduces reliance on external funding over time.\n\nThe open-source codebase allows the community to maintain, extend, and adapt the infrastructure even if Charli3 steps back, ensuring resilience.\n\nTransparent governance ensures decisions around updates, templates, and integrations remain aligned with community needs rather than a single entity’s control.\n\n8. Risk Management\n\nRisks have been mitigated through clear planning, phased delivery, and independent audits.\n\nIntegration work will be validated by transaction proofs and public endpoints. Back-end and front-end functions will be demonstrated through public demos. Documentation and usability will be confirmed by external testers.\n\nBy publishing all code, docs, and results on GitHub, we ensure maximum transparency. Any gaps in adoption or functionality can be addressed by the broader ecosystem.\n\nThe contingency reserve ensures that if unexpected technical challenges arise, they do not compromise the overall success of the project.\n\n9. Direct Return on Catalyst’s Investment\n\nFor the Cardano ecosystem, value manifests in:\n\nA fully functioning oracle marketplace and launchpad, live and accessible to all.\n\nReduction of duplicated costs across projects that would otherwise each build isolated oracle systems.\n\nIncreased developer and community participation due to lower barriers to entry.\n\nStronger positioning of Cardano in the next market cycle, with oracles no longer a limiting factor for DeFi, lending, and RWA adoption.\n\nA permanent open-source contribution that strengthens Cardano’s technical foundation.\n\nConclusion\n\nAt ₳595,000, this proposal provides exceptional value for money by combining:\n\nA proven track record of technical delivery.\n\nA commitment to open-source and public good.\n\nA transparent, role-based financial plan with contingency.\n\nInfrastructure that addresses one of Cardano’s most critical adoption bottlenecks.\n\nWide community benefit across developers, operators, projects, and retail participants.\n\nThis project ensures that Cardano does not just “have oracles,” but has a scalable, accessible, community-owned data infrastructure layer that will sustain growth and adoption for years to come.\n\n[Required Acknowledgements] Consent & Confirmation\n\nTerms and Conditions:\n\n+ Read more\n\nRobert Hever - Project Lead - Co Founder Charli3.io |\n\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/robhever/\n\nCore 4 developer team from Charli3.io\n\nWe have close ties with Anastasia Labs, Mlabs, and Txpipe.
